## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
````
Having a plan going into anything is useful as some problems can be foreseen and taken care of before there is an issue.  A plan also helps with organization.  However, every plan will have to change once the task begins because things change.
````
2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
````
I give it some thought for a short period of time and snoop around on Google looking to see if someone else found a solution to the same or a similar problem.
````
3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
````
I have a lot to learn to move from a newbie programmer to a professional programmer.  Several of the mistakes mentioned have been made by me and I realize I do not have the knowledge to know how best to correct the issue...yet.
