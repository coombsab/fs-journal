# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
````
Working as a partner on Thursday went well and was enjoyable.  We hit all of the necessary points, though did not get stretch goals complete.  This was an improvement on speed as a team from the previous week.
````
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
````
There wasn't really anything that was a shock or particularly a surprise.  The boss monster assignment was surprisingly fun, but seeming I have an interest in game development and design, that only makes sense..
````
- What are you struggling with?
````
No particular struggles this week either.  The main item I am going to look into is making a health bar for the boss monster assignment, but I have some ideas on how to do that.  There was also a suggestion that bootstrap may already have a css class that can handle it.
````
- What would you count as a victory?
````
The week as a whole is a victory.  Staying focused and reviewing JavaScript while trying to pick out the new things to learn has been rewarding.
