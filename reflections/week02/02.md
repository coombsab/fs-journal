## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
````
Function Declaration (function someFunction () {})
  Definition is hoisted
Function Expression (let someFunction = function(parameters) {})
  Definition is not hoisted
Arrow Function Expression (let someFunction = (parameters) => {})
  Definition is not hoisted and no this created for function
````
2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
````
A parameter is the name of an argument inside the function and the value is the argument.
````
3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
````
A higher order function is when a function either accepts a function as a parameter or returns a function.  Array.prototype.map and Array.prototype.filter are both higher order functions.
