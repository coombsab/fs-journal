## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
````
Directly in the console or through console.log() in the JavaScript file.  Both can be useful for debugging, but console.log() is primarily useful for seeing what the code is doing at certain places while writing directly to the console can also be useful for testing functions.
````
2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
````
Element tab.  It is useful because changes can be made without having to switch windows, change the actual code and save it.  Plus those changes are only temporary so if messed up, refreshing clears the mistake.
````
3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
````
Using the debugging tool and adding breakpoints.
