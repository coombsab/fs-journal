## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
```
We used pair programming in our hackathon project, though we did not do it particularly well.  Definitely needed more improvement with the navigator role being engaged and the driver communicating.
```
2. What went well this week?
```
We were pretty good about communicating during the design phase but lost a bit when getting into development.
```
3. What would you do differently?
```
Make sure to better communicate when tasks are complete on one end and work the pair programming more effectively.
```
