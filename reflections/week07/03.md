## Questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?
```
User experience is the experience a user has interacting with your company's products, regardless of where the interaction occurs.  One should consider what the user wants to do more than what the company wants to do to create a better UX.
```
2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?
```
The primary benefit is the user enjoying the experience more and being more likely to return.  In some ways, by changing color, shape, designs, etc the user can be directed to feel a certain way (e.g. welcomed or not welcomed)
```
3. Why is the User Experience important?
```
If users do not use the product then the product fails.
