## Questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?
```
Pair programming is when two developers work on a project from one workstation.  The driver types out the code and verbalizes what they are doing/thinking while the navigator thinks ahead and watches to catch mistakes, typos, etc.
```
2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
```
Two pairs of eyes looking at the code gives better accuracy and consistency.  Better diffusion of knowledge between the team & potentially transfer of skills.  Backup for each other as more know intimately how the code works.
```
3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?
```
Passivity, primarily.  If both developers are not actively engaged then the return lessens greatly.
