## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?
```
Code documentation comes in several forms, from tutorials and readme files to things like JSDocs.  This documentation is used to describe the code written so that in several months it can still be easily understood, or when a new person is learning what it does.
```
2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?
```
Passing knowledge along to team members and ease of rememberance regarding how to use code.
```
3. How important is Code documentation and why?
```
Generally it is very important to avoid ambiguity and keep code clear and easy to understand, but with good naming practices and for some languages that already describe well, it can lose some benefit.  Overall, it is a good practice to use.
