# Daily Reflection
One day left are you going to make it? We believe in you!ðŸ’–! Are you timeboxing appropriately? 

## Prompts
- How is today going?
```
Grading is going a bit slow so the first grading didn't happen until about 11-11:30 today but I got 100% so... DONE.  Maybe some stretch goals to work on after.
```
- Are you managing your stress?
```
A little stress due to grading being slow, wasn't sure there would be time for 3 gradings.
```
- What has you most worried?
```
Time and opportunity for all 3 grading attempts.
