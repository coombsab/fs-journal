# Daily Reflection
This is a stressful week! You are working on a project that closely mimics what you will be expected to accomplish during a standard 40 hour work week. Are you enjoying the struggles? Are you managing your time wisely? 

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
```
Work went well and wrapped up the backend.
```
- Are you managing your stress?
```
Nothing to worry about so no particular stress.
```
- What has you most worried?
```
Things that may come up later in the week that show perhaps something that was passing on the backend still does not work quite right.
