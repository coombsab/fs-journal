# Daily Reflection
Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? How are you working? Client -> Server, focusing only on the server for now?  

## Prompts
- How is today going?
```
This would have been easier to do if I had done it each day, but still...Tuesday the frontend was coming along nicely and I felt I was maybe ready for the first grading but still not to 100%, so did not try for grading.
```
- Are you managing your stress?
```
Still no particular worries to stress over.
```
- What has you most worried?
```
Small things that were easy to miss with the frontend.
