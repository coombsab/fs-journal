## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`
```
primary is the unique identifier for the current table, foreign key is a unique identifier for an external table
```
2. What is an `Alias`?
```
an alias is basically a short name for a table to save space when writing longer, more complex sql queries
```
3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```
```
SELECT * FROM doctors doc
JOIN doctors d on d.id = doc.doctorId
JOIN patients p on p.id = doc.patientId
```
