## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.
```
     My main concern about the final is managing my time wisely.  I do not believe the concepts will be something I have trouble with.  It is also very easy to miss a small part of a requirement, so reviewing those periodically to make sure I do not miss something will be important, as well.
     For my time, I plan to make a short log of how much time I actually spend on the project and see how close I can get to completing it within what would be a 40 hour work week.  This way I can know if a typical 40 hour workload as a junior developer is reasonable for my skill level.  In order to better facilitate this, I plan to make sure I timebox tasks where I tend to put in too much time to ensure I get through all of the minimum functionality before adding extra bits in or taking too long to figure out how to get something to work.
     I have enjoyed the course overall, but I really liked solving the whiteboard Wednesday problems and the morning challenges.

     My biggest concern as the course wraps up is that I have too much of a reliance upon the templates BCW has provided.  I understand they are useful and perhaps some of the setup would be beyond maybe a junior developer level, but it bothers me that without the template I do not know how to setup vue, .net or node into a working project.  I may be able to resolve some of that by going through the template more and taking a look at how things are set up.
