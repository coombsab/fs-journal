## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?
```
Setting a limit of time for working on a task.
```
2. What three strategies will you implement and how?
```
Utilizing a timer, estimating the actual time it will take (this will take some practice) and working on the less pleasant items first.
```
3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 
```
In the week-4 checkpoint, I could have used timeboxing to limit the time I spent with the original html/css design so I could have had more lab time to work on the javascript.  This way if I had javascript issues, I could ask questions to the instructors or TAs.
