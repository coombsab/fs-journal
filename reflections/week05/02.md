## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?
```
One to one, one to multiple, multiple to multiple
```
2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`
```
The main advantage to linking instead of embedding is being able to paginate over a smaller portion of a larger list.

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?
```
It seems primarily the challenge is determining how many items would be in any category because somewhat larger armounts can easily become overwhelmingly large and exceed the maximum size limit.
