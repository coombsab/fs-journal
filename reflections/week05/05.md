# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
```
Most attempts went well this week, except Monday.  (Note, could be different for Thursday and Friday as it is currently Wednesday)
```
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
```
No shocks or surprises, really.
```
- What are you struggling with?
```
I struggled getting some server commands to work on Monday using a fake database and no authentication, but after starting on MongoDB on Tuesday I was able to get the four CRUD methods to work fine.
```
- What would you count as a victory?
```
I completely finished the server-side (backend) on Tuesday and implemented the frontend from last week's Gregslist to access the server.  It was pretty cool.
