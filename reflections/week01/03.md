## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
````
Adding a splash of color to a bland design with just a small bar to the edge.  I can think of places this would have been more visually interesting in some personal projects.
````
2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
````
A better looking site definitely catches the eye more and is probably more likely to be used.  The design may also feel more intuitive if certain schemes are followed and consistent.  Importance can be conveyed through design alone, simply by emphasis put on a specific item.
