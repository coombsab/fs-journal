# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
````
In general everything went pretty well this week.  I enjoyed learning more about bootstrap and organizing via their grid system.
````
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
````
There are several selectors for different screen sizes that I am surprised bootstrap does not have.
````
- What are you struggling with?
````
The biggest struggle was trying to work with another to develop the same item.  I noticed we both slowed down as a team when separately we get a lot more work done.  Time to balance and improve on teamwork will be essential.
````
- What would you count as a victory?
````
The victory is being here, learning and enjoying the first week.  On to Javascript next week!
