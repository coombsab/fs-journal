## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?
````
To give all stakeholders the ability to see and interact with a design in order to finalize said design.
````

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
````
Low fidelity, mid fidelity and high fidelity.  Each one is useful as they are created at different points in the design process and provide a different level of detail.  This allows a design to be gradually finalized and adjusted throughout the process.
````
3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
````
I generally believe they are worth the effort, yes.  It is important to get a mock layout of a design done so the stakeholders (or even the developer) can more easily see how the application works together.  This can help eliminate some issues before any coding even occurs.  Which, in the long run, may save time and money.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
````
I mostly want to take away the different levels of wire frames, as the way it was presented differed from my work experience.  I recall seeing several high-fidelity wire-frames, but had never really worked with earlier versions.
