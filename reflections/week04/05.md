# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

Mostly everything went just fine.  It was fun laying out the pokedex stuff, in particular sorting out the measurements for the pokemon (height/weight)
```
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
```
Nothing particularly shocking or surprising this week.
```
- What are you struggling with?
```
It took a little while to sort out the previous/next pagination for the pokedex assignment.
```

```
I managed to finish each afternoon assignment to generally do what was expected, even if not all the stretch goals were reached...but they function.
