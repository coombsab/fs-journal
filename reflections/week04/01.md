> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?
```
Nexted callback functions.
```
2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?
```
Asynchronous means code can run at different times, rather than all sequential.  Callbacks tend to be used in places where code might benefit from being async. (e.g. I/O, downloading)
```
3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`
```
1. Keep your code shallow - avoid too much nesting and instead separate the code out.
2. Modularize - create small modules of code that do small things and use those modules together to do larger things.
3. Handle every single error - this seems specifically related to errors in callbacks and mostly has to do with platform errors rather than errors in the code (those the programmer has to fix as part of the writing).
