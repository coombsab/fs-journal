> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
```
Keeping multiple elements synced with the same data
```
2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
```
subscribe, unsubscribe and broadcast
```
3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
```
There is a proxy set up in AppState.js that validates props and emits on a set, but I am unsure yet as to how this specifically links to the observer pattern.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
```
Seems simple but also complicated, definitely worth spending some time to figure out.  I particularly like that the pattern can be expanded on and used in many situations.
