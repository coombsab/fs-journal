## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
```
Mainly the purpose of encapsulation is to restrict access to internal data that is not intended to be manipulated by an external party.
```
2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
```
From what I gathered, closures worked fine for the most part but weren't commonly known and similarly the underscore prefix was followed by some but was not widely known or respected, so fairly commonly not followed.
```
3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
```
By defining them in a class with the # prefix.  I could do this to force encapsulation and keep access to the variable private.  This helps in case the internal structure needs to change in the future.

```
Closures are also viable for encapsulation and looked interesting to try, though I need to understand a little more about how to create them.
