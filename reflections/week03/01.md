## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?
```
Solves the problem of having to add multiple scripts as only specific parts of a script file can be exported to be used elsewhere.
```
2. How does export differ from export default?
```
Export grabs specific functions while default does not need to be specified, as only those defined as default are grabbed.
```
3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?
```
One benefit is not having to worry about naming conventions in different files overlapping, as module1.sumAll() would be different from module2.sumAll().
