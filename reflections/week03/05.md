# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
```
Everything has gone well so far.
```
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
```
Nothing in particular was shocking or surprising this week.  The most significant was an issue with assigning an ID versus just generating an ID, but the issue was how I looked at it and after talking it through with a TA, we figured out where the issue was.
```
- What are you struggling with?
```
Group projects are still somewhat of a struggle.  Always much slower and I do not want to overly control or push my partner the way I want to do things, but I also want us to move along a bit quicker.
```

- What would you count as a victory?
```
Still enjoying practicing and learning development; enjoying what I am doing is always a victory.
