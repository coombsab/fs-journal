## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?
```
A list of one type of value.  Similar to an array.
```
2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?
```
Sort, add, remove, find, findall, insert, reverse... these are the main things I recall trying to do with arrays in the past so I figure they will likely be the most used with lists.
```
3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?
```
Depends, if I know the index then list[index], if not I could find the index (index = list.IndexOf(value)) and use that index.  Or simply list.Find(item)
