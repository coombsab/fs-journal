## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?
```
Too many meetings can bog down the time used for development and make the process take drastically longer.  Keeping communication open is useful, but needs to be somewhat restricted to specific meetings and not overdone.
```
2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?
```
Possibly meeting times and finding the right balance between fast, good and cheap.  Reducing hands on meetings and shifting some meetings to slack (or other apps) can help.
```
3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
```
Good done cheap is not fast.
Fast done good is not cheap.
Cheap done fast is not good.
```
