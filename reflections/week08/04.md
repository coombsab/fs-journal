## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
```
Unit - test small units of code, can vastly improve confidence in the performance of that unit
Component - tests components a reliable way to test components attach to the DOM
End to End - tests the app from end to end as close to the expected end user experience as possible and finds any unexpected issues through typical (and sometimes atypical) use
```
2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
```
They all have their uses and it just depends on how they are implemented and what is being worked on.  For small projects, more end to end testing might be the best as the time cost is not so high but for larger, more complex projects, unit and component testing will be much more important.  E2E cannot be neglected too much, or more unexpected issues will get to the end user.
```
3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
```
See above for this answer.
