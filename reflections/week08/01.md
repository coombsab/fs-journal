## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
```
A place to showcase one's skills and abilities.
```
2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
```
Showing projects that have meaning and quality code.
```
3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
```
With a little rework, inspire would be fun to add and maybe the most recent checkpoint.

Inspire because I enjoy using it for things like my grocery list, but it needs some changing to be a little more ideal for the use.

The recent checkpoint (Tower) because the app came together very nicely and works well.  There is some small styling I would tweak first, but I need some time to learn a better way to show what I want to show.

Looks like if I want to take finding a job as a developer seriously I will need to build a portfolio.  Along those same lines I also need to find some projects to create that would be useful to add.
