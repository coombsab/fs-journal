## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
```
Vue, node.js, scrum/agile development, partner programming, vscode
```
2. What went well so far?
```
For the most part all areas went pretty well.. we have not had many merge conflicts and the ones we had were easy to resolve.  We did wind up changing our API, but we did that before we really used it anywhere so it went well.
```
3. What would you do differently? Why?
```
Probably have a second meeting about styling consistencies/changes after we got going.  It would also have been nice to have some feature where socket implementation would have been useful.
