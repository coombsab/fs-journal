Extended Validation - shows https, business name and country in the address bar and is used to show legitimacy of a domain (most expensive and secure, needed for identity comfirmations such as payment info)
Organization Validation - verifies organization and domain are legitimate (small green padlock with company name, less secure but more affordable than EV)
Domain Validation - lowest level of valication (small green padlock, does not vet any identity info)
